About the notebooks
==================
[Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) notebooks provide a great opportunity to put together code, text and graphics 
in a reproducible and accessible way. Therefore, the examples for this package are being  amended by a series of Pluto notebooks.
Like the example code, the notebook code is tested during CI.
