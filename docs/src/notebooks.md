About the notebooks
==================
[Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) notebook provide a great opportunity to put together code, text and graphics 
in a reproducible and accessible way. Therefore, the examples for this package will be amended by a series of Pluto notebooks.
These use an [updated and simplified](/nbhtml/api-update) version of the VoronoiFVM API.
