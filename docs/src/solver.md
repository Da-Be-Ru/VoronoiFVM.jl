# Solvers

The package comes with a [built-in solve method](@ref "Built-in solver") which solves 
stationary problems, homotopy embedding problems and transient problems 
via the implicit Euler method. In particular, the transient solver allows to use
nonlinear storage terms.

Alternatively, [OrdinaryDiffEq.jl based solvers](@ref diffeq) can be used 
for transient problems.


## Built-in solver
This solver and its default parameters are tuned for robustness,
possibly at the expense of solution speed. Careful tuning of the parameters, or -- in the case of transient problems --
the choice of a [OrdinaryDiffEq.jl based solver](@ref diffeq) can significantly improve the performance.

Overview:
- [Solve method](@ref "Solve method")
- [Solver control](@ref "Solver control")
- [System state](@ref "System state")
- [Linear solver stragies](@ref "Linear solver strategies")
- [Block preconditioning](@ref "Block preconditioning")
- [History handling](@ref "History handling")
- [Matrix extraction](@ref "Matrix extraction")

### Matrix extraction
For testing and teaching purposes, one can obtain residual and linearization at a given vector of unknowns

## [OrdinaryDiffEq.jl transient solver](@id diffeq)

For transient problems, as an alternative to the [built-in implicit Euler method](@ref "Built-in solver"), (stiff) ODE solvers from 
[OrdinaryDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl)  can be used.

The interface just provides two methods: creation of an [ODEProblem](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/basics/overview/#Defining-Problems) from a [`VoronoiFVM.System`](@ref) and a reshape method
which turns the output of the ode solver into a [`TransientSolution`](@ref).

The basic usage pattern is as follows: use [OrdinaryDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl) and replace the call to the built-in solver
```julia
sol=solve(sys; times=(t0,t1), inival=inival)
```
by
```julia
problem = ODEProblem(sys,inival,(t0,t1))
odesol = solve(problem, solver)
sol=reshape(odesol,sys)
```
Here, `solver` is some  ODE/DAE solver from [OrdinaryDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl).
It is preferable to choose methods able to handle [stiff problems](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/solvers/ode_solve/#Stiff-Problems).
Moreover, often, discretized PDE systems (e.g. containing elliptic equations) are differential agebraic equation (DAE) systems 
which should be solved by [DAE solvers](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/solvers/dae_solve/).
Some choices to start with are Rosenbrock methods like 
[Rosenbrock23](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/solvers/dae_solve/#Rosenbrock-W-Methods)
and multistep methods like [QNDF](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/solvers/dae_solve/#Multistep-Methods)
and [FBDF](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/solvers/dae_solve/#Multistep-Methods).

If the [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://github.com/SciML/DifferentialEquations.jl)
package is loaded, the `solver` parameter can be omitted, and some default is chosen.

The solution `odesol` returned by `solve` conforms to the [ArrayInterface](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/basics/solution/#Array-Interface)
but "forgot" the VoronoiFVM species structure. Using 

Accessing `odesol(t)` will return an interpolated solution vector giving
the value of the solution at moment `t`. Using [`reshape(::AbstractVector, ::VoronoiFVM.AbstractSystem)`](@ref) on `(odesol(t),system)` it can be turned into into a
sparse or dense array reflecting the species structure of `system`. The order of the [interpolation](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/basics/solution/#Interpolations-and-Calculating-Derivatives)
depends on the ODE solver.

Using [`reshape(::AbstractDiffEqArray,::VoronoiFVM.AbstractSystem)`](@ref) on `(odesol, system)` returns a [`TransientSolution`](@ref) knowing
the species structure.

## Legacy API
During the development of the code, a number of API variants have been developed which 
are supported for backward compatibility.
